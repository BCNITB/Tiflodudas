Braille Commands
JAWS® supports a series of keystrokes that allow you to input braille commands and also control your computer (see BrailleIn™ description below). Below are keystrokes that support Freedom Scientific’s Focus braille displays. For other braille displays, contact the manufacturer for a list of keystrokes.

Many commands listed here include the word “CHORD.” To perform a chorded command, you always include the SPACEBAR as part of the command. For example, L CHORD or DOTS 1-2-3 and the SPACEBAR.

Modifier Keys
Use the modifier keys to simulate key combinations (keystrokes) that include CTRL, ALT, WINDOWS Key, SHIFT, or the JAWS Key (INSERT). To use these modifiers when typing a keystroke, do the following:

Hold down DOT 8 CHORD and then press the corresponding modifier keys in the keystroke. Modifier keystrokes are listed in the following table.
After you create the modifier portion of the keystroke, release the keys and press the remaining part of the keystroke. For example, to perform the keystroke CTRL+SHIFT+V, you press DOTS 3-7-8 CHORD, release the keys, and then press V (DOTS 1-2-3-6).

Key Name	Keystroke
Function Keys (F1 through F12)
For more information, see the Function Keys description.	DOT 1
INSERT	DOT 2
CTRL	DOT 3
WINDOWS Key	DOT 4
JAWS Key	DOT 5
ALT	DOT 6
SHIFT	DOT 7
Instead of memorizing these keys by their dot position, it may be easier to learn the finger with which each key would be associated. When all of your fingers are on the braille keyboard, the layout would be:

Key Name	Finger position
Function Keys (F1 through F12)	Left index finger
WINDOWS Key	Right index finger
INSERT	Left middle finger
JAWS Key	Right middle finger
CTRL	Left ring finger
ALT	Right ring finger
SHIFT	Left little finger
Notice that you can create a rather loose correlation between pairs of fingers in this description. For example, the left index finger is Function Keys while the right index finger is the WINDOWS key. A stronger correlation can be made with the left and right middle fingers. The left is the INSERT Key and the right is the JAWS key, both often serving the same purpose in JAWS usage. Finally, the left and right ring fingers are the CTRL and ALT keys respectively, which make these two positions easier to remember.

Once this layout is understood, it is easy to grasp that Any time a modifier key, or combination of modifier keys is used as part of a command, DOT 8 CHORD will always be included.

Finally, pressing any of these modifier keys with DOT 8 CHORD is the same as pressing and holding any of the equivalent keys on the QWERTY keyboard. The computer is waiting for the key or keys which the modifier keys will modify. So, pressing DOTS 3-8 CHORD is the same as pressing the CTRL key. Windows then waits for the key which will complete the CTRL combination, such as the letter A to make CTRL+A to select all, or the letter C to make CTRL+C to copy the selected text to the clipboard. Repetition of frequently used keystrokes such as the CTRL key combinations already mentioned, Windows commands such as WINDOWS Key+M, and JAWS commands such as INSERT+T should imprint these key associations firmly in your memory.

Function Keys
To simulate the function keys (F1 through F12), press DOTS 1-8 CHORD followed by A through L (which correspond to 1 through 12). For example, to simulate the F6 key, press DOTS 1-8 CHORD, then F (DOTS 1-2-4). If the function key is part of a key combination, add the appropriate modifiers while holding down DOTS 1-8 CHORD. For example, to simulate the keystroke INSERT+F2, press DOTS 1-2-8 CHORD, then B (DOTS 1-2).

Special Keys
Use these keystrokes to simulate certain keys that are not available on the Focus braille keyboard. These keys can be combined with the modifier keys described previously. For your convenience, both keystrokes and braille dot patterns are provided. If no dot pattern equivalent is available, a dash appears in the table cell.

Using BrailleIn to Type with Contracted Braille
The BrailleIn feature lets you type in contracted braille using your Perkins-style keyboard. The input is immediately translated back as normal text in your current e-mail, document, or form. If an application or specific edit box does not support contracted braille, JAWS announces “Computer Braille” when tutor messages are enabled. In addition, the Computer Braille start symbol, dots 4-5-6 followed by dots 3-4-6, is shown on the braille display to indicate when Computer Braille is required.

Computer braille input is selected by default. To use contracted braille, do the following:

Press INSERT+F2, and select Settings Center.
To apply changes to all applications, press CTRL+SHIFT+D to load the JAWS default settings. To apply changes to a specific application, select it from the Applications combo box.
In the Search edit box, type “Translation” without the quotes.
Press DOWN ARROW to move to Translation in the filtered search results in the tree view and press ENTER to move focus to the Translation group. Press RIGHT ARROW to expand the group.
Press SPACEBAR to cycle through the different settings in the Output combo box to configure the mode for reading braille on your display.
The first option is always Computer Braille. The other available options depend on the currently selected language. For example, when the language is set to English United States, which is the default setting, the available output modes are U.S. English Grade 1, U.S. English Grade 2, Unified English Braille Grade 1, and Unified English Braille Grade 2. If you set the language to French, the available modes are French Grade 1 and French Grade 2. The default output mode is Computer Braille.
Press SPACEBAR to cycle through the different settings in the Input combo box to specify the input mode used when typing braille from the Perkins-style keyboard on your display.
The first option is always Computer Braille. The other available option depends on the currently selected output mode. For instance, if you have chosen to display Unified English Braille Grade 2, then you can choose to type in either Computer Braille or Unified English Braille Grade 2. The default input mode is Computer Braille. This setting is not available if the selected output mode is Computer Braille, or the selected output mode does not support input.
